# Wanhao_i3_zbrace

A minimal but steady z-brace mod for the wanhao i3 v2.1

Materials needed for the braces i used:
4 x M4 Right Hand Thread Rod End Joint
4 x Press fitting M4 threaded sleeve rod bar
4 x M4 square nuts
Carbon fiber tubes  OD 7mm ID 5mm x 350mm minumum
10 x M315mm screws

You can use different materials, make sure the rod end joint are without bearings otherwise it will be better to glue them (a drop or cyanoacrylate glue will do the job) Since I've already had had the carbon fiber tubes, i have used press fitting sleeves (and glued them into the tubes) and male rod ends. You can use threaded rods instead of the carbon fiber tubes and a female rod end joint instead, it will make the installation a little quicker.

The holes for the square nuts are about the same dimension of the nuts, to insert them heat them up with a ligher and press them into the hole, this way they will not fall and will be steady inserted in the support.
